# Lung-Cancer-Awareness

As part of my learning journey, I developed a project titled   "Lung Cancer Awareness and Risk Assessment Platform"  . This project was a significant milestone in leveraging AI to address critical public health issues.

  Project Highlights:  
🔍   Objective:   Developed a platform to increase lung cancer awareness by educating the public on early symptoms, risk factors, and support services.

🤖   AI Tools and Technologies:  
-   IBM Watson Assistant:   Created an AI chatbot to provide personalized support and real-time information.
-   IBM Watson Studio:   Built and deployed machine learning models for lung cancer prediction using the Snap Random Forest Classifier.
-   Cloud Object Storage:   Ensured data security and disaster recovery through robust storage solutions.

💡   Key Features:  
- Personalized risk assessments based on user data.
- AI-driven symptom checker to recommend medical consultations.
- Curated educational content tailored to user preferences.
- Interactive Q&A chatbot for instant, anonymous health research.

📈   Results:   Achieved a model accuracy of 78% and overcame deployment challenges to ensure a fully operational platform.

🌍   Impact:   Contributed to raising awareness about lung cancer, supporting early detection, and aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal of "Good Health and Well-being".

Grateful for this incredible learning experience and looking forward to applying these skills in future endeavors!
